Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software—to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to all software that is covered by the license, and it has two main goals:

  1. To make sure that you have the freedom to share the software and make changes to it so that it can be used by anyone.
  2. To make sure that the software is free for all of its users, and that the software is not made proprietary.

                            TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the author(s) saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications, that is based on the Program. (This includes any work that is a modification of the Program or has been combined with the Program.) Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Program.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
     b) You must distribute your modified works under the same license as the original, or under a compatible license, if required by the terms of this license.

  3. You may not impose any further restrictions on the rights granted by this License.

  4. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.

  5. You must keep intact the copyright notice and all notices that refer to this License.

  6. If you distribute the Program or a work based on the Program, you must make the source code available to recipients. This can be done by providing a copy of the source code or by providing a written offer to supply the source code.

  7. If you combine the Program with other software, and distribute the combined work, the entire combined work must be distributed under the terms of this License.

                             NO WARRANTY

  8. Because the Program is licensed free of charge, there is no warranty for the Program, to the extent permitted by applicable law. Unless required by law, the author(s) and copyright holder(s) provide the Program "as is" without warranty of any kind.
